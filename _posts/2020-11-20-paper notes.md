***I will use this blog to summarize paper I read as well as my thoughts.***


# Topic: disparity

**Article**: Kelsey M. Owsley, Mika K. Hamer, Glen P. Mays, “The Growing Divide in the Composition of Public Health Delivery Systems in US Rural and Urban Communities, 2014–2018”, American Journal of Public Health 110, no. S2 (July 1, 2020): pp. S204-S210.

**Aim**: To examine changes in the scope of activity and organizational composition of public health delivery systems serving rural and urban US communities between 2014 and 2018

**Conclusion**:
Urban public health systems have enhanced their scope of activities and organizational networks since 2014, whereas rural systems have lost capacity. These trends suggest that system improvement initiatives have had uneven success

**Data resource**: National Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems

**Measures**: scope of activity, network density, a composite measure of public health system capability

**Statistical Analysis**: linear models with a Gaussian family

**comments**
* current efforts to strengthen public health systems may primarily benefit urban communities while leaving rural communities behind
*	consolidated regional public health districts, joint purchasing and staffing models, multijurisdictional governance and advisory bodies, and other forms of pooling

# Topic: Medicaid expansions

**Article**: Lindrooth, R. C., Perraillon, M. C., Hardy, R. Y., & Tung, G. J. (2018). Understanding the relationship between medicaid expansions and hospital closures. Health Affairs, 37(1), 111-120.

**Aim**: To examine a hypothesis that Medicaid expansion of eligibility for childless adults prevents hospital closures

**Conclusion**:
*	ACA’s expansion of eligibility for Medicaid for childless adults was associated with significant reductions in the probability of hospital closures
*	The relationship was stronger at hospitals in areas with higher uninsurance rates


**Data resource**: The Healthcare Provider Cost Reporting Information System and the Provider of Services files

**Measures**: The association of ACA Medicaid expansions and the outcomes

**Statistical Analysis**: Difference in differences.
The hospital closure model was estimated using logistic regression


**comments**:	When making decisions related to hospital subsidies and other forms of financial support, policy makers should also consider whether a hospital closure is harmful to patients.
