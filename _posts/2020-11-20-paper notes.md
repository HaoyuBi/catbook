# Topic: disparity

**Article**: Kelsey M. Owsley, Mika K. Hamer, Glen P. Mays, “The Growing Divide in the Composition of Public Health Delivery Systems in US Rural and Urban Communities, 2014–2018”, American Journal of Public Health 110, no. S2 (July 1, 2020): pp. S204-S210.

**Aim**: To examine changes in the scope of activity and organizational composition of public health delivery systems serving rural and urban US communities between 2014 and 2018

**Conclusion**:
Urban public health systems have enhanced their scope of activities and organizational networks since 2014, whereas rural systems have lost capacity. These trends suggest that system improvement initiatives have had uneven success

**Data resource**: National Longitudinal Survey of Public Health Systems
**Measures**: scope of activity, network density, a composite measure of public health system capability

**Statistical Analysis**: linear models with a Gaussian family

**comments**
* current efforts to strengthen public health systems may primarily benefit urban communities while leaving rural communities behind
*	consolidated regional public health districts, joint purchasing and staffing models, multijurisdictional governance and advisory bodies, and other forms of pooling
