***This is a research proposal about Research of Eyeball Growth and Refractive Status in Children Aged 0-6 years: A Longitudinal Study. The project is in the initial stage and we are still applying funds for this project.***

# Introduction & Background
Children are in the critical and sensitive period of visual development. From the beginning of the newborn's eyeball development, both genetic and environmental factors can cause various eye diseases. If timely detection and treatment cannot be given during this period, it will cause permanent visual impairment, which will not only affect the physical and mental health, quality of life as well as academic performance of children, but also impact social harmony and bring economic burden for government and healthcare industry. Therefore, it is necessary to carry eye screening since childhood.

Although the development of the eyeball and refractive status continues throughout the life of a person, experiencing the process of emmetropization<sup>1</sup>, 0-6 years old is a critical period for eyeball development, visual development and changes in various eye biological parameters. The balance development among the biological parameters of the various tissues is important to ensure the emmetropization process. At about 6 years of age, the eye development of a person has almost reached adult level. Previous related researches<sup>2-4</sup> show that many factors can accelerate the growth of the eyeball and therefore form myopia, such as the effect of eye axis, corneal curvature, lens thickness and intraocular pressure on the spherical wall, hyperopia defocus and body development. Besides, with the increasing prevalence of myopia across the world, myopia has become the main reason that influence the vision of children and adolescents. It is estimated that by 2050, the number of people with myopia and high myopia in the world will increase from 1.406 billion and 168 million in 2000 to 4.758 billion and 938 million respectively<sup>5</sup>, which means that half of the global population may be affected by myopia by 2050. It will bring a huge social and economic burden for healthcare industry.

In addition, it is hard to attract parent’s attention until their children cannot see clearly. At this time, the development of myopia has been irreversible. As myopia deepens, some children will progress to high myopia, which may cause related complications such as glaucoma, retinal detachment, macular hemorrhage and even vision loss and blindness. Therefore, follow-up observation for children who have not yet developed myopia, monitoring of children with high risk for myopia, and intervention in children who have developed myopia will be crucial for the prevention and control of myopia.

There are many researches about myopia in children. However, most of them are based on selected populations. In addition, most reports are cross sectional studies. Longitudinal study is rare due to the possible reason that a longer follow-up time and a higher rate of loss to follow-up. Longitudinal study can observe the refractive changes of a certain group and each individual within a certain period of time through repeated inspections, which can not only reveal development of refractive status, but also reveal changes in ocular biological parameters. The relationship between the incidence and progress of myopia is of great significance for understanding the pathogenesis of myopia and providing effective treatment strategies.

Therefore, we designed the follow-up observation to record eyeball development and refractive status of children aged 0-6. Through the study, we can better understand the rules of eyeball development and analyze the relationship between ocular biological parameters and refractive status, and predict the development of refractive status based on changes in eyeball biological parameters.

# Literature Review
Olav H Haugen, Gunnar Høvding, Isa Lundström<sup>6</sup> conducted a population based, longitudinal study to research refractive development in children with Down’s syndrome. They randomly chose 60 children with Down’s syndrome and repeatedly did retinoscopy in cycloplegia for 2 years or more. At the same time, accommodation of those children was recorded. They discovered that a stable, low grade hypermetropia was significantly correlated with a normal accommodation and weak accommodation is positive related with the high frequency of refractive errors for patients with Down’s syndrome. Dennis S. C. Lam et al<sup>7</sup> did a school-based, cross-sectional survey about parental myopia, parental education level, and near work performed by the child among children 5 to 16 years of age and then conducted a longitudinal cohort study one year later. They discovered that parental history of myopia influences the growth rate of the children’s eyes, rather than their size before the onset of myopia. A R O’Connor<sup>8</sup> assessed eye parameter of 293 low birth weight children at 10–12 years of age and discovered that those children have an increased prevalence of all refractive errors and both low birth weight and retinopathy of prematurity significantly impact the refractive state in the long term. Seang-Mei Saw<sup>9</sup> examined the relationship among height, weight, body mass index and refraction and other ocular parameters in Singapore Chinese children. They discovered that taller Singapore Chinese children had eyes with longer axial lengths, deeper vitreous chambers, flatter corneas, and refractions that tended toward myopia. Children who were heavier or who had a higher BMI tended to have refractions that were more hyperopic.

All of those studies reveal that childhood is a key period for the healthy development of eye and refractive status can be easily influenced by many factor. According to following the changes of eyeball biological parameter, some eye disease can be detected early and have a higher cure rate for children. A long-term observation for eyeball growth and refractive status among children is hard to find as far.

#	Research Design
* Newborn infants are selected from the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University. All infants should be normal delivered. Infants with serious systemic disease or birth weight ≥2500g should be excluded. Parents should sign the informed consent form if they agree that their child can participant the research.
* We will number each child and record personal information, including name, sex, birth date, gestational age, address, height, weight, parents’ name and contact details (Appendix 1)
* The third step is measuring the baby's height, weight, head circumference, chest circumference, eye appearance, anterior segment, and fundus color photographs within 1 week after birth. Newborns with abnormal growth and development should be excluded and take treatment.
* For normal newborn without abnormal growth, height, weight, head circumference, chest circumference, vision, intraocular pressure, eye appearance, eye position, eye movement, anterior segment, eye fundus color photographs, eye biological parameters and diopter should be measured when they are 1 month old, 3 months old, 6 months old, 8 months old, 12 months old, 18 months old, 24 months old, 30 months old, 3 years old, 4 years old, 5 years old, 6 years old. If any abnormal growth is discovered during these periods, the infant should be excluded and take treatment.
* During each period, we should assess the eye health and refractive status of each child according to the eye development of normal children of different ages. If children with abnormal refractive errors are found, they should be given dilated examination in time. Children who still have abnormal refractive error after dilated examination should be treated with refractive correction in time, and eye health education should be carried out according to each child's eye development.
* Finally, eye parameters of children included in this study will be input into excel and SPSS25.0 will be used for statistical analysis. Both linear and quadratic mixed model regression are used.
